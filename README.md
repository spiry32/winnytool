# winnytool 1.1
WinnyTool is a Windows 10/11 Tool created to install apps faster via a terminal.

This is an updated version of one of my previous releases, [chocolatier](https://github.com/spiry32/chocolatier)
# How to use?
You have 2 options : 

1 Just run the .exe

Works without installing golang
 
                             -OR-
                             
2 Build the app.go file using **go build -o app.exe app.go**

Go must be installed [https://go.dev/doc/install]
