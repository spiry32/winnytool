# winnytool
WinnyTool is a Windows 10/11 Tool created to install apps faster via a terminal.

This is an updated version of one of my previous releases, [chocolatier](https://github.com/spiry32/chocolatier)
# How to use?
You have 2 options : 

1 Build the app.go file using **go build -o app.exe app.go**
 
                             -OR-
                             
- Just run the .exe

# BUGS!!! ⚠️
* Some apps may not download correctly, because of the download link. Fixing that in the new version.
